If a direct shipper, whether located in this state or outside this state, owns, in whole or in part, or commonly manages 1 or more direct shippers, it shall not in combination ship to consumers in this state more than 13,500 liters of wine in the aggregate.

(i) Pay wine taxes quarterly and report to the commission quarterly the total amount of wine, by type, brand, and price, shipped to consumers in this state during the preceding calendar quarter, and the order numbers.

(j) Authorize and allow the commission and the department of treasury to conduct an audit of the direct shipper's records.

(k) Consent and submit to the jurisdiction of the commission, the department of treasury, and the courts of this state concerning enforcement of this section and any related laws, rules, and regulations.

(4) Notwithstanding subsection (3), in the case of a sale, delivery, or importation of alcoholic liquor occurring by any means described in subsection (3), a person taking the order on behalf of the direct shipper shall comply with subsection (3)(c) through (g).

(5) A person that delivers the wine for a direct shipper under this section shall verify that the individual accepting delivery is 21 years of age or older and is the individual who placed the order or the designated recipient, is an individual 21 years of age or older currently occupying or present at the address, or is an individual otherwise authorized through a rule promulgated under this act by the commission to receive alcoholic liquor under this section. If the delivery person, after a diligent inquiry, determines that the purchaser or designated recipient is not 21 years age or older, the delivery person shall return the wine to the direct shipper. A delivery person who returns wine to the direct shipper because the purchaser or designated recipient is not 21 years of age or older is not liable for any damages suffered by the purchaser or direct shipper.

(6) All spirits for sale, use, storage, or distribution in this state, shall originally be purchased by and imported into the state by the commission, or by prior written authority of the commission.

(7) This section does not apply to alcoholic liquor brought into this state for personal or household use in an amount permitted by federal law by an individual 21 years of age or older at the time of reentry into this state from without the territorial limits of the United States if the individual has been outside the territorial limits of the United States for more than 48 hours and has not brought alcoholic liquor into the United States during the preceding 30 days.

(8) An individual 21 years of age or older may do either of the following in relation to alcoholic liquor that contains less than 21% alcohol by volume:

(a) Personally transport from another state, once in a 24-hour period, not more than 312 ounces of alcoholic liquor for that individual's personal use, notwithstanding subsection (1).

(b) Ship or import from another state alcoholic liquor for that individual's personal use if that personal importation is done in compliance with subsection (1).

(9) A direct shipper shall not sell, deliver, or import wine to a consumer unless it applies for and is granted a direct shipper license from the commission. This subsection does not prohibit wine tasting or the selling at retail by a wine maker of wines he or she produced and bottled or wine manufactured for that wine maker by another wine maker, if done in compliance with this act. Only the following persons qualify for the issuance of a direct shipper license:

(a) A wine maker.

(b) A wine producer and bottler located inside this country but outside of this state holding both a federal basic permit issued by the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau and a license to manufacture wine in its state of domicile.

The application shall be accompanied by a copy or other evidence of the existing federal basic permit or license, or both, held by the applicant. The direct shipper may renew its license annually by submission of a license renewal fee of $100.00 and a completed renewal application. The commission shall use the fees collected under this section to conduct investigations and audits of direct shippers. The failure to renew, or the revocation or suspension of, the applicant's existing Michigan license, federal basic permit, or license to manufacture wine in its state of domicile is grounds for revocation or denial of the direct shipper license. If a direct shipper is found guilty of violating this act or a rule promulgated by the commission, the commission shall notify both the alcoholic liquor control agency in the direct shipper's state of domicile and the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau of the United States department of treasury of the violation.

(12) A retailer that holds a specially designated merchant license in this state or an out-of-state retailer that holds its state's substantial equivalent license may utilize a third party that provides delivery service to municipalities in this state that are surrounded by water and inaccessible by motor vehicle to deliver beer and wine to the home or other designated location of that consumer if the delivery service is approved by the commission and agrees to verify that the individual accepting delivery of the beer and wine is at least 21 years of age.

(a) The person satisfies all applicable commission rules prescribing qualifications for licensure promulgated under section 215.

(b) The person has entered into a written agreement or contract with a supplier of spirits for the purposes of warehousing and delivering a brand or brands of spirits of that supplier of spirits.

(4) An authorized distribution agent shall deliver to each retailer located in its assigned distribution area on at least a weekly basis if the order meets the minimum requirements. Except that in those weeks that accompany a state holiday, the commission may order a modified delivery schedule provided that a retailer waits not longer than 9 days between deliveries due to a modified delivery schedule. The commission shall provide for an integrated on-line ordering system for spirits and shall require the continuance of any ordering system in existence on the activation date of the system established under section 206. The minimum requirements shall be set by the commission and shall be a sufficient number of bottles to comprise not more than 2 cases. A retailer may pick up the product at the authorized distribution agent's warehouse. To avoid occasional emergency outages of spirits, a retail licensee may make up to 12 special emergency orders to an authorized distribution agent per calendar year which order shall be made available to the retail licensee within 18 hours of the placing of the order. A special emergency order placed on Saturday or Sunday shall be made available to the retail licensee before noon on the following Monday. An authorized distribution agent may impose a fee of up to $20.00 to deliver a special emergency order to a retail licensee.

(5) In locations inaccessible to a motor vehicle as that term is defined by the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.1 to 257.923, the authorized distribution agent shall arrange that a delivery of spirits to a retailer be in compliance with the following procedures:

(a) After processing an order from a retailer, an authorized distribution agent shall contact a retailer to confirm the quantity of cases or bottles, or both, and the exact dollar total of the order.

(b) The authorized distribution agent shall have the responsibility to coordinate with the retailer the date and time a driver is scheduled to deliver the order to a ferry transport dock, shall arrange any ferry, drayage, or other appropriate service, and shall pick up the retailer's payment at that time.

(c) The ferry transport company or company representing any other form of conveyance shall take the retailer's payment to the mainland dock and give that payment to the authorized distribution agent's driver.

(d) The ferry transport company or company representing any other form of conveyance shall transport the order to the drayage or other appropriate company at the island dock for immediate delivery to the retailer.

(e) The drayage or other appropriate company shall deliver the order to the retailer.

(6) The authorized distribution agent is responsible for the payment of all transportation and delivery charges imposed by the ferry, drayage, or other conveyance company and is responsible for all breakage and any shortages, whether attributable to the ferry, drayage, or other conveyance company or any combination of those companies, until the order is delivered to the retailer's establishment. This subsection does not in any way prevent the authorized distribution agent from seeking reimbursement or damages from any company conveying the authorized distribution agent's product.

(7) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4), an authorized distribution agent shall not charge a delivery fee or a split-case fee for delivery of spirits sold by the commission to a retailer.

(8) An authorized distribution agent or prospective authorized distribution agent shall maintain and make available to the commission or its representatives, upon notice, any contract or written agreement it may have with a supplier of spirits or other authorized distribution agent for the warehousing and delivery of spirits in this state.

(9) For any violation of this act, rules promulgated under this act, or the terms of an order appointing an authorized distribution agent, an authorized distribution agent shall be subject to the suspension, revocation, forfeiture, and penalty provisions of sections 903(1) and 907 in the same manner in which a licensee would be subject to those provisions. An authorized distribution agent aggrieved by a penalty imposed by the commission may invoke the hearing and appeal procedures of section 903(2) and rules promulgated under that section.

(10) A specially designated distributor may sell to an on-premises licensee up to 9 liters of spirits during any 1-month period and an on-premises licensee may purchase, collectively from specially designated distributors, up to that amount during any 1-month period. Notwithstanding any other provision of this act or rule promulgated under this act, a specially designated distributor is only liable for knowingly violating this section. Records verifying these purchases shall be maintained by the on-premises licensee and be available to the commission upon request.

(11) An authorized distribution agent shall demonstrate that it has made a good faith effort to provide employment to those former state employees who were terminated due to the privatization of the liquor distribution system. A good faith effort is demonstrated by the authorized distribution agent performing at least the following actions:

(a) Seeking from the commission a list of names and resumes of all such former state employees who have indicated a desire for continued employment in the distribution of liquor in Michigan.

(b) Providing a list of employment opportunities created by the authorized distribution agent in the distribution of liquor in Michigan to each individual whose name and resume is transmitted from the commission.

(c) Providing an opportunity for application and interview to any terminated state worker who indicates an interest in pursuing a job opportunity with the authorized distribution agent.

(d) Providing a priority in hiring for those individuals who apply and interview under this process.

(12) Any former state employees terminated due to privatization who have reason to believe that an authorized distribution agent has not made a good faith effort to provide him or her with employment opportunities as described in subsection (11) may file a complaint with the commission who shall hear the complaint and make a determination on its validity. If the commission determines that the complaint is valid, the violation may be treated as a violation of this act and the authorized distribution agent may be subject to the suspension, revocation, forfeiture, and penalty provisions of sections 903(1) and 907.

(13) In addition to paying a vendor of spirits the acquisition price for purchasing spirits, the commission may pay a vendor of spirits an additional amount of not less than $4.50 and not more than $7.50 for each case of spirits purchased as an offset to the costs being incurred by that vendor of spirits in contracting with an authorized distribution agent for the warehousing and delivery of spirits to retailers. The payment described in this subsection shall not be included in the cost of purchasing spirits by the commission and shall not be subject to the commission's markup, special taxes, or state sales tax. The per-case offset established by this subsection may be increased by the state administrative board each January to reflect reasonable increases in the authorized distribution agent's cost of warehousing and delivery. As used in this subsection, "case" means a container holding twelve 750 ml bottles of spirits or other containers containing spirits which are standard to the industry.

Sec. 409.

(1) Except as provided in this section, the commission shall levy and collect a tax on all beer manufactured or sold in this state at the rate of $6.30 per barrel if the beer is sold in bulk or in different quantities.

(2) Beginning on and after February 1, 2015, the tax shall be paid by the brewer or brewpub if the beer is manufactured in this state or if the beer is manufactured outside this state the tax shall be paid by the wholesaler assigned to distribute that beer and the tax shall be levied and collected on the number of barrels the wholesaler actually sold to licensed retailers in this state. A brewer may designate a wholesaler to pay the tax on behalf of the brewer. If a brewer designates a wholesaler to pay the tax on its behalf, the brewer shall notify the commission of the designation and provide the commission with a copy of its brewer's report of operations that it filed with the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau of the United States department of treasury for each calendar year.

(3) The commission shall establish by rule a method for the collection of the tax levied under subsection (1) and reporting requirements for wholesalers, brewers, brewpubs, and outstate sellers of beer to verify the remission of taxes to this state. The commission shall not require that the tax be paid in less than monthly intervals. The rules shall be promulgated pursuant to the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328.

(4) The tax levied in subsection (1) shall not be collected on beer that is consumed on the premises of the manufacturer or is damaged in the process of brewing, packaging, storage, and distribution and is not offered for sale, except that beer sold by a brewpub for consumption on the premises or beer produced and consumed on the premises of a micro brewer is subject to the tax levied under subsection (1).

(6) For the purposes of the tax levied under subsection (1), a barrel of beer contains 31 gallons.

(7) The commission may promulgate a rule that designates the states or the laws or the rules of other states that require a licensed wholesaler of beer to pay an additional fee for the right to purchase, import, or sell beer manufactured in this state; that denies the issuance of a license authorizing the importation of beer to any wholesaler of beer in that state who applies for the license; that prohibits wholesalers of beer in that state from possessing or selling beer purchased in this state, unless the person from whom the beer was purchased has secured a license and paid a fee in that state, if the seller does not transport the beer into the state and does not sell the beer in the state; or that imposes any higher taxes or inspection fees upon beer manufactured in this state when transporting the beer into or selling the beer in that state than taxes or fees imposed upon beer manufactured and sold within that state. A rule promulgated under this subsection shall prohibit all licensees from purchasing, receiving, possessing, or selling any beer manufactured in any state designated in the rule. A rule promulgated under this subsection becomes effective as provided in section 47 of the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.247. Any licensee or person adversely affected by a rule promulgated under this subsection is entitled to review by leave to a court of competent jurisdiction regarding the question as to whether the commission acted illegally or in excess of its authority in making its finding under this subsection with respect to any state.

(8) Regardless of whether the tax was remitted to this state by the eligible brewer or a designated wholesaler, an eligible brewer may claim a credit or request a refund, in a manner as determined by the commission, against the tax levied under subsection (1) in the amount of $2.00 per barrel for the first 30,000 barrels. As used in this subsection, "eligible brewer" means a brewer, whether or not located in this state, or brewpub that manufactures not more than 50,000 barrels of beer during the tax year for which the credit is claimed. In determining the number of barrels for purposes of the credit, all brands and labels of a brewer shall be combined and all facilities for the production of beer that are owned or controlled by the same person shall be treated as a single facility.

However, the commission shall not impose the $20,000.00 initial license fee for applicants whose license eligibility was already approved on July 20, 2005.

(3) If the commission requires an applicant to submit fingerprints, the applicant shall have the fingerprints taken by a local law enforcement agency, the department of state police, or any other person qualified to take fingerprints as determined by the department of state police.

(4) Except in the case of any resort or resort economic development license issued under section 531(2), (3), (4), or (5) or a license issued under section 521a, the commission shall issue an initial or renewal license not later than 90 days after the applicant files a completed application. The application is considered to be received the date the application is received by any agency or department of this state. If the commission determines that an application is incomplete, the commission shall notify the applicant in writing, or make the information electronically available, within 30 days after receipt of the incomplete application, describing the deficiency and requesting the additional information. The determination of the completeness of an application is not an approval of the application for the license and does not confer eligibility upon an applicant determined otherwise ineligible for issuance of a license. The 90-day period is tolled for the following periods under any of the following circumstances:

(a) If notice is sent by the commission of a deficiency in the application, until the date all of the requested information is received by the commission.

(b) For the time required to complete actions required by a person, other than the applicant or the commission, including, but not limited to, completion of construction or renovation of the licensed premises; mandated inspections by the commission or by any state, local, or federal agency; approval by the legislative body of a local unit of government; criminal history or criminal record checks; financial or court record checks; or other actions mandated by this act or rule or as otherwise mandated by law or local ordinance.

(5) If the commission fails to issue or deny a license within the time required by this section, the commission shall return the license fee and shall reduce the license fee for the applicant's next renewal application, if any, by 15%. The failure to issue a license within the time required under this section does not allow the commission to otherwise delay the processing of the application, and that application, upon completion, shall be placed in sequence with other completed applications received at that same time. The commission shall not discriminate against an applicant in the processing of the application based upon the fact that the license fee was refunded or discounted under this subsection.

(6) If, in addition to a completed application under this section, an applicant submits a separate form requesting a conditional license with an acceptable proof of financial responsibility form under section 803, and an executed property document, the commission shall, after considering the arrest and conviction records or previous violation history in the management, operation, or ownership of a licensed business, approve or deny a conditional license. A conditional license issued under subsection (7) for the transfer of an existing license at the same location shall include any existing permits and approvals held in connection with that license. The following applicants may request a conditional license:

(a) An applicant seeking to transfer ownership of or interest in an existing license at the same location to sell alcoholic liquor for consumption on or off the premises.

(b) An applicant seeking an initial license other than a specially designated distributor license or a license for the sale of alcoholic liquor for consumption on the premises.

(7) The commission shall issue a conditional license to applicants approved under subsection (6) within 20 business days after receipt of a completed application and a completed conditional license request form and documentation for a conditional license at a single location. The commission may take up to 30 business days to issue conditional licenses to approved applicants seeking conditional licenses at multiple locations.

(8) A conditional license approved under subsection (6) and issued under subsection (7) is nontransferable and nonrenewable. A conditional license approved under subsection (6) and issued under subsection (7) expires when the commission issues an order of denial of the license application that serves as the basis for the conditional license after all administrative remedies before the commission have been exhausted, expires 20 business days after the commission issues an order of approval of the license application that serves as the basis for the conditional license, expires when the licensee or conditional licensee notifies the commission in writing that the initial application should be canceled, or expires 1 year after the date the conditional license was issued, whichever occurs first. If a conditionally approved licensee fails to maintain acceptable proof of its financial responsibility, the commission shall, after due notice and proper hearing, suspend the conditional license until the licensee files an acceptable proof of financial responsibility form under section 803. If a conditional license is revoked, the conditional licensee shall not recover from a unit of local government any compensation for property, future income, or future economic loss due to the revocation.

(9) Upon issuing a conditional license under subsection (7), the commission shall, until the conditional license expires under subsection (8), place an existing license under subsection (4) in escrow in compliance with R 436.1107 of the Michigan administrative code. If the conditional license expires because a transfer of an existing license was denied or because the license was not transferred within the 1-year period, an existing licensee may do 1 of the following:

(a) Request that the commission release the license from escrow.

(b) Keep the license in escrow. The escrow date for compliance with R 436.1107 of the Michigan administrative code shall be the date the conditional license expires.

(10) The chair of the commission shall submit a report by December 1 of each year to the standing committees and appropriations subcommittees of the senate and house of representatives concerned with liquor license issues. The chair of the commission shall include all of the following information in the report concerning the preceding fiscal year:

(a) The number of initial and renewal applications the commission received and completed within the 90-day time period described in subsection (4).

(b) The number of applications denied.

(c) The number of applicants not issued a license within the 90-day time period and the amount of money returned to licensees under subsection (5).

(11) As used in this section, "completed application" means an application complete on its face and submitted with any applicable licensing fees as well as any other information, records, approval, security, or similar item required by law or rule from a local unit of government, a federal agency, or a private entity but not from another department or agency of the state of Michigan.

Sec. 531.

(1) A public license shall not be granted for the sale of alcoholic liquor for consumption on the premises in excess of 1 license for each 1,500 of population or major fraction thereof. An on-premises escrowed license issued under this subsection may be transferred, subject to local legislative approval under section 501(2), to an applicant whose proposed operation is located within any local governmental unit in a county in which the escrowed license was located. If the local governmental unit within which the former licensee's premises were located spans more than 1 county, an escrowed license may be transferred, subject to local legislative approval under section 501(2), to an applicant whose proposed operation is located within any local governmental unit in either county. If an escrowed license is activated within a local governmental unit other than that local governmental unit within which the escrowed license was originally issued, the commission shall count that activated license against the local governmental unit originally issuing the license.

A minor who violates this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by the following fines and sanctions and is not subject to the penalties prescribed in section 909:

(a) For the first violation by a fine of not more than $100.00. A court may order a minor under this subdivision to participate in substance abuse prevention services or substance abuse treatment and rehabilitation services as defined in section 6107 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.6107, and designated by the administrator of the office of substance abuse services, and may order that minor to perform community service and to undergo substance abuse screening and assessment at his or her own expense as described in subsection (5).

(b) For a second violation of this subsection, section 33b(1) of former 1933 (Ex Sess) PA 8, or a local ordinance substantially corresponding to this subsection or section 33b(1) of former 1933 (Ex Sess) PA 8, by imprisonment for not more than 30 days but only if the court finds that the minor violated an order of probation, failed to successfully complete any treatment, screening, or community service ordered by the court, or failed to pay any fine for that conviction or juvenile adjudication, by a fine of not more than $200.00, or both. A court may order a minor under this subdivision to participate in substance abuse prevention services or substance abuse treatment and rehabilitation services as defined in section 6107 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.6107, and designated by the administrator of the office of substance abuse services, to perform community service, and to undergo substance abuse screening and assessment at his or her own expense as described in subsection (5).

(2) An individual who furnishes fraudulent identification to a minor, or notwithstanding subsection (1) a minor who uses fraudulent identification to purchase alcoholic liquor, is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days or a fine of not more than $100.00, or both.

(3) When an individual who has not previously been convicted of or received a juvenile adjudication for a violation of subsection (1) pleads guilty to a violation of subsection (1) or offers a plea of admission in a juvenile delinquency proceeding for a violation of subsection (1), the court, without entering a judgment of guilt in a criminal proceeding or a determination in a juvenile delinquency proceeding that the juvenile has committed the offense and with the consent of the accused, may defer further proceedings and place the individual on probation. The terms and conditions of that probation include, but are not limited to, the sanctions set forth in subsection (1)(a), payment of the costs including minimum state cost as provided for in section 18m of chapter XIIA of the probate code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.18m, and section 1j of chapter IX of the code of criminal procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 769.1j, and the costs of probation as prescribed in section 3 of chapter XI of the code of criminal procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 771.3. If a court finds that an individual violated a term or condition of probation or that the individual is utilizing this subsection in another court, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt, or a determination in a juvenile delinquency proceeding that the individual has committed the offense, and proceed as otherwise provided by law. If an individual fulfills the terms and conditions of probation, the court shall discharge the individual and dismiss the proceedings. Discharge and dismissal under this section shall be without adjudication of guilt or without a determination in a juvenile delinquency proceeding that the individual has committed the offense and is not a conviction or juvenile adjudication for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime. An individual may obtain only 1 discharge and dismissal under this subsection. The court shall maintain a nonpublic record of the matter while proceedings are deferred and the individual is on probation and if there is a discharge and dismissal under this subsection. The secretary of state shall retain a nonpublic record of a plea and of the discharge and dismissal under this subsection. These records shall be furnished to any of the following:

(a) To a court, prosecutor, or police agency upon request for the purpose of determining if an individual has already utilized this subsection.

(b) To the department of corrections, a prosecutor, or a law enforcement agency, upon the department's, a prosecutor's, or a law enforcement agency's request, subject to all of the following conditions:

(ii) The record is used by the department of corrections, the prosecutor, or the law enforcement agency only to determine whether an employee has violated his or her conditions of employment or whether an applicant meets criteria for employment.

(4) A violation of subsection (1) successfully deferred, discharged, and dismissed under subsection (3) is considered a prior violation for the purposes of subsection (1)(b) and (c).

(5) A court may order an individual convicted of violating subsection (1) to undergo screening and assessment by a person or agency as designated by the substance abuse coordinating agency as defined in section 6103 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.6103, in order to determine whether the individual is likely to benefit from rehabilitative services, including alcohol or drug education and alcohol or drug treatment programs. A court may order an individual subject to a conviction or juvenile adjudication of, or placed on probation regarding, a violation of subsection (1) to submit to a random or regular preliminary chemical breath analysis.

(6) The secretary of state shall suspend the operator's or chauffeur's license of an individual convicted of violating subsection (1) or (2) as provided in section 319 of the Michigan vehicle code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.319.

(7) A peace officer who has reasonable cause to believe a minor has consumed alcoholic liquor or has any bodily alcohol content may require that individual to submit to a preliminary chemical breath analysis. A peace officer may arrest an individual based in whole or in part upon the results of a preliminary chemical breath analysis. The results of a preliminary chemical breath analysis or other acceptable blood alcohol test are admissible in a criminal prosecution to determine whether the minor has consumed or possessed alcoholic liquor or had any bodily alcohol content. A minor who refuses to submit to a preliminary chemical breath test analysis as required in this subsection is responsible for a state civil infraction and may be ordered to pay a civil fine of not more than $100.00.

(8) A law enforcement agency, upon determining that an individual less than 18 years of age who is not emancipated under 1968 PA 293, MCL 722.1 to 722.6, allegedly consumed, possessed, purchased alcoholic liquor, attempted to consume, possess, or purchase alcoholic liquor, or had any bodily alcohol content in violation of subsection (1) shall notify the parent or parents, custodian, or guardian of the individual as to the nature of the violation if the name of a parent, guardian, or custodian is reasonably ascertainable by the law enforcement agency. The law enforcement agency shall notify the parent, guardian, or custodian not later than 48 hours after the law enforcement agency determines that the individual who allegedly violated subsection (1) is less than 18 years of age and not emancipated under 1968 PA 293, MCL 722.1 to 722.6. The law enforcement agency may notify the parent, guardian, or custodian by any means reasonably calculated to give prompt actual notice including, but not limited to, notice in person, by telephone, or by first-class mail. If an individual less than 17 years of age is incarcerated for violating subsection (1), his or her parents or legal guardian shall be notified immediately as provided in this subsection.

(1) Except as otherwise provided in this act, before the approval and granting, or renewal, of a license, the following licensees or applicants for that license shall make, execute, and deliver to the commission a bond executed by a surety company authorized to do business in the state or, in the discretion of the commission, by approved personal surety running to the people of the state, in the following amounts:

(a) A manufacturer of beer, a manufacturer of wine, a mixed spirit drink manufacturer, an outstate seller of beer, an outstate seller of mixed spirit drink, and an outstate seller of wine, a bond in an amount equal to 1/12 of the total beer, mixed spirit drink, or wine excise taxes paid to the state in the last calendar year or a bond in the sum of $1,000.00, whichever is greater, for the faithful performance of the conditions of the license issued and for compliance with this act. A surety shall not cancel a bond issued under this subdivision except upon 30 days' written notice to the commission.

(b) A special license authorizing the sale of beer, mixed spirit drink, wine, or spirits for consumption on the premises, a bond in the sum of $1,000.00. A bond issued under this subdivision shall remain in effect for 60 days after the expiration of the special license. A bond is not required for a church or school.

(2) A retail licensee shall not directly, individually, or by a clerk, agent, or servant sell, furnish, or give alcoholic liquor to a minor except as otherwise provided in this act. A retail licensee shall not directly or indirectly, individually or by a clerk, agent, or servant sell, furnish, or give alcoholic liquor to a person who is visibly intoxicated.

(3) Except as otherwise provided in this section, an individual who suffers damage or who is personally injured by a minor or visibly intoxicated person by reason of the unlawful selling, giving, or furnishing of alcoholic liquor to the minor or visibly intoxicated person, if the unlawful sale is proven to be a proximate cause of the damage, injury, or death, or the spouse, child, parent, or guardian of that individual, shall have a right of action in his or her name against the person who by selling, giving, or furnishing the alcoholic liquor has caused or contributed to the intoxication of the person or who has caused or contributed to the damage, injury, or death. In an action pursuant to this section, the plaintiff shall have the right to recover actual damages in a sum of not less than $50.00 in each case in which the court or jury determines that intoxication was a proximate cause of the damage, injury, or death.

(4) An action under this section shall be instituted within 2 years after the injury or death. A plaintiff seeking damages under this section shall give written notice to all defendants within 120 days after entering an attorney-client relationship for the purpose of pursuing a claim under this section. Failure to give written notice within the time specified shall be grounds for dismissal of a claim as to any defendants that did not receive that notice unless sufficient information for determining that a retail licensee might be liable under this section was not known and could not reasonably have been known within the 120 days. In the event of the death of either party, the right of action under this section shall survive to or against his or her personal representative. In each action by a husband, wife, child, or parent, the general reputation of the relation of husband and wife or parent and child shall be prima facie evidence of the relation, and the amount recovered by either the husband, wife, parent, or child shall be his or her sole and separate property. The damages, together with the costs of the action, shall be recovered in an action under this section. If the parents of the individual who suffered damage or who was personally injured are entitled to damages under this section, the father and mother may sue separately, but recovery by 1 is a bar to action by the other.

(5) An action under this section against a retail licensee shall not be commenced unless the minor or the alleged intoxicated person is a named defendant in the action and is retained in the action until the litigation is concluded by trial or settlement.

(6) Any licensee subject to the provisions of subsection (3) regarding the unlawful selling, furnishing, or giving of alcoholic liquor to a visibly intoxicated person shall have the right to full indemnification from the alleged visibly intoxicated person for all damages awarded against the licensee.

(7) All defenses of the alleged visibly intoxicated person or the minor shall be available to the licensee. In an action alleging the unlawful sale of alcoholic liquor to a minor, proof that the defendant retail licensee or the defendant's agent or employee demanded and was shown a Michigan driver license or official state personal identification card, appearing to be genuine and showing that the minor was at least 21 years of age, shall be a defense to the action.

(8) There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a retail licensee, other than the retail licensee who last sold, gave, or furnished alcoholic liquor to the minor or the visibly intoxicated person, has not committed any act giving rise to a cause of action under subsection (3).

(9) The alleged visibly intoxicated person shall not have a cause of action pursuant to this section and a person shall not have a cause of action pursuant to this section for the loss of financial support, services, gifts, parental training, guidance, love, society, or companionship of the alleged visibly intoxicated person.

(10) This section provides the exclusive remedy for money damages against a licensee arising out of the selling, giving, or furnishing of alcoholic liquor to a minor or intoxicated person.

(11) Except as otherwise provided for under this section and section 815, a civil action under subsection (3) against a retail licensee shall be subject to the revised judicature act of 1961, 1961 PA 236, MCL 600.101 to 600.9947.

**436.1805 Suit to enforce liability when service of process not effected; affidavit; service upon commission in duplicate; return; copy served on defendant; hearing; duty of commission.**

Sec. 805.

If an action is instituted against a retailer as defendant in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the liability provided in section 801 and service of process has not been effected in the manner provided for by law, and either the sheriff or constable to whom process has been delivered for service shall make return that he or she has not been able to serve the defendant for a period of 30 days, in which period he or she has made 3 or more attempts to serve the defendant at his or her residence or place of business, or the plaintiff or another person with knowledge of the facts files an affidavit in the cause stating that the defendant has ceased to be a resident of the state of Michigan or has been absent from the state for a continuous period of 6 months, then it shall be competent for the plaintiff to cause service of process to be made upon the defendant by service of the process upon the commission, the liability for which suit is brought arose during the period in which the defendant was a licensed retailer and was insured under the provisions of section 803. Such service of process shall be made in duplicate on the commission, and return showing such service shall be made to the court. The commission shall mail a copy of the process served upon it to the defendant at the address shown in the consent to service of process, and shall immediately transmit to the clerk of the court in which the action is pending an acknowledgment of the mailing of the copy of that process by the commission to the defendant.

Sec. 903.

(1) The commission or any commissioner or duly authorized agent of the commission designated by the chairperson of the commission, upon due notice and proper hearing, may suspend or revoke any license upon a violation of this act or any of the rules promulgated by the commission under this act. The commission or any commissioner or duly authorized agent of the commission designated by the chairperson of the commission, may assess a penalty of not more than $300.00 for each violation of this act or rules promulgated under this act, or not more than $1,000.00 for each violation of section 801(2), in addition to or in lieu of revocation or suspension of the license, which penalty shall be paid to the commission and deposited with the state treasurer and shall be credited to the general fund of the state. The commission shall hold a hearing and order the suspension or revocation of a license if the licensee has been found liable for 3 or more separate violations of section 801(2) which violations occurred on different occasions within a 24-month period unless such violations for the sale, furnishing, or giving alcoholic liquor to a minor were discovered by the licensee and disclosed to an appropriate law enforcement agency immediately upon discovery. A retail licensee who sells, offers to sell, accepts, furnishes, possesses, or allows the consumption of spirits in violation of section 901(6) is subject to an administrative fine of not more than $2,500.00 per occurrence and the following license sanctions after notice and opportunity for an administrative hearing under the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328:

(a) For a first violation, a license revocation or suspension for between 1 and 30 days.

(b) For a second violation, a license revocation or suspension for between 31 and 90 days.

(c) For a third or subsequent violation, revocation of the license.

(2) The commission shall provide a procedure by which a licensee who is aggrieved by any penalty imposed under subsection (1) and any suspension or revocation of a license ordered by the commission, a commissioner, or a duly authorized agent of the commission may request a hearing for the purpose of presenting any facts or reasons to the commission as to why the penalty, suspension, or revocation should be modified or rescinded. Any such request shall be in writing and accompanied by a fee of $25.00. The commission, after reviewing the record made before a commissioner or a duly authorized agent of the commission, may allow or refuse to allow the hearing in accordance with the commission's rules. The right to a hearing provided in this subsection, however, shall not be interpreted by any court as curtailing, removing, or annulling the right of the commission to suspend or revoke licenses as provided for in this act. A licensee does not have a right of appeal from the final determination of the commission, except by leave of the circuit court. Notice of the order of suspension or revocation of a license or of the assessment of a penalty, or both, shall be given in the manner prescribed by the commission. The suspension or revocation of a license or the assessment of a penalty, or both, by the commission or a duly authorized agent of the commission does not prohibit the institution of a criminal prosecution for a violation of this act. The institution of a criminal prosecution for a violation of this act or the acquittal or conviction of a person for a violation of this act does not prevent the suspension or revocation of a license or the assessment of a penalty, or both, by the commission. In a hearing for the suspension or revocation of a license issued under this act, proof that the defendant licensee or an agent or employee of the licensee demanded and was shown, before furnishing any alcoholic liquor to a minor, a motor vehicle operator or chauffeur license or a registration certificate issued by the federal selective service, or other bona fide documentary evidence of majority and identity of the person, may be offered as evidence in a defense to a proceeding for the suspension or revocation of a license issued under this act. A licensee who has reason to believe that a minor has used fraudulent identification to purchase alcoholic liquor in violation of section 703 shall file a police report concerning the violation with a local law enforcement agency and shall also present the alleged fraudulent identification to the local law enforcement agency at the time of filing the report if the identification is in the possession of the licensee. The commission may promulgate rules pursuant to the administrative procedures act of 1969, 1969 PA 306, MCL 24.201 to 24.328, regarding the utilization by licensees of equipment designed to detect altered or forged driver licenses, state identification cards, and other forms of identification.

(3) In addition to the hearing commissioners provided for in section 209, the chairperson of the commission may designate not more than 2 duly authorized agents to hear violation cases. A person appointed under this subsection shall be a member in good standing of the state bar of Michigan.

(4) A duly authorized agent who has been designated by the chairperson pursuant to subsection (3) shall have, in the hearing of violation cases, the same authority and responsibility as does a hearing commissioner under this act and the rules promulgated under this act.

(5) A duly authorized agent who has been designated by the chairperson pursuant to subsection (3) shall be ineligible for appointment to the commission for a period of 1 year after the person ceases to serve as a duly authorized agent.
