### Locality

Most localities will have limits to which zoning allows alcohol production. In most cases this will be Commercial districts. You can sometimes get special use permits or ask for amendments. In our case there is already an [amendment for wineries and cideries](zoning_18_25.md) which we hope to amend further for distilleries.
